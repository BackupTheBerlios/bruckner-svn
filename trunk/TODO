TODO for Bruckner:

/*
 TODO:
 - make sure a song is played when 'Play' is pressed 
 - no Dock icon?
 */

* shuffle / change repeat mode

* a way to select:
	a) Playlist
	b) Album to play

* Dock menu and Window menu should have 'Show Navigation Panel' entry

* L10n (at least German. This is easy.)

* User Preferences:
	[ ] Launch iTunes on startup
	[x] Show Album Art in Dock
	    Hotkey: <F6>

* Better Artwork

* More Core Animation (where appropriate)

* actually use the StatusItem code + MAAttachedWindow
	is this _really_ needed?
	
* Re-think program architecture. 
  Would it make sense to use ArrayController for Playlist songs / album songs?
