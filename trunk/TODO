TODO for Bruckner:

Roadmap to Bruckner 1:
----------------------

* change repeat mode

* a way to select:
	a) Playlist
	b) Album to play

* Dock menu and Window menu should have 'Show Navigation Panel' entry

* scale albumArt using CoreGraphics!

Roadmap to Bruckner 2:
----------------------

* L10n (at least German. This is easy.)

* User Preferences:
	[ ] Launch iTunes on startup
	[x] Show Album Art in Dock
	    Hotkey: <F6>

* Better Artwork

* More Core Animation (where appropriate)
	- Navigation Panel 
		- shake it when shuffle mode is selected?
		- skim to right on 'next track'
		- skim to left on 'previous track'
	- Desktop Window
		- if shuffle mode & new song: rotate window, then display new album artwork
	- rotation is disturbing. Slowling fade in / fade out.	
	

Roadmap to Bruckner 3:
----------------------

* Search iTunes stuff


Anytime:
--------

* actually use the StatusItem code + MAAttachedWindow
	is this _really_ needed?
	
* Re-think program architecture. 
  Would it make sense to use ArrayController for Playlist songs / album songs?
